Collection of scripts to read data from the TED 1001 whole house meter
(http://www.theenergydetective.com).  Most of the scripts originated
from Micah Dowty (http://micah.navi.cx/) and were modified by me
(Brandon Tallent <btallent@gmail.com> to work with my setup.  I am 
reading from the TED 1001 onto a debian linux fileserver.  ted-daemon.py
runs in the background and collects data from the TED RDU into a couple
RRD databases.  A cron job runs update-graphs.sh every minute to 
generate fresh graphs into the root apache web directory (/var/www 
by default on debian) and a simple PHP script is available for
viewing the graphs.  The ted-daemon.py script also writes 
an XML file in the original TED Footprints DashboardData
format so that other applications (Ted Toolbar for firefox for example)
can read the data.
